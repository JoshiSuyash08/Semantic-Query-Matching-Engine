Semantic Query Matching Engine
Introduction
The Semantic Query Matching Engine employs the Deep Structured Semantic Model (DSSM) framework to facilitate semantic matching within information retrieval systems. This sophisticated engine is adept at discerning semantic similarities between queries and document collections, thereby significantly improving the precision and efficiency of document retrieval, question answering, and recommendation systems. Its implementation showcases the potential of deep learning algorithms in understanding and processing natural language, setting a new standard for accuracy in information retrieval tasks.

Features
Incorporates the DSSM architecture, leveraging Siamese networks for advanced text representation learning.
Applies cosine similarity to measure and compare the semantic proximity between queries and documents.
Evaluated using standard metrics like MAP, MRR, and NDCG to ensure robust performance in information retrieval.
Project Structure
The project is structured around a core Jupyter notebook that details the implementation of the DSSM-based semantic matching engine. This includes a comprehensive approach to training the model, performing similarity assessments, and conducting information retrieval with a focus on maximizing relevance and accuracy.

Evaluation
Utilizing the Cranfield dataset, the engine undergoes rigorous evaluation to quantify its effectiveness in information retrieval. Metrics such as MAP, MRR, and NDCG serve as benchmarks for its performance, guiding further optimization and refinement to enhance its utility in real-world applications.
